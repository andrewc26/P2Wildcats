Idea: Our idea is a website that teaches you about animals and their nature.

Navigation Bar: This will have a page for the animals to learn about them as well as an about us page and embedded videos.
  Nav Bar will have Search Bar which will let you search for different wildcats.

Big Ticket Idea: Search Bar that searches from the database on the animals we have put information on.
Search Bar: Take from Database of all the Wildcats that we have information on and use that in order to present the unformation we have when the search bar is used.
