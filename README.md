Idea: Our idea is a website that teaches you about animals and their nature.

Summary: The idea and summary of the website is to teach about the different wildcats in nature and their ways of living in their natural habitats. Users will be able to use a search bar to find different wild cats and find out facts about them.

What different animals will be shown? Since we are the wildcats, we will have wildcats and animals that they interact with including predators and prey. We are centering it on the Wildcat group.

Navigation Bar: This will have a page for the animals to learn about them as well as an about us page and embedded videos.

Midterm: First Fully website with select few wildcats available to learn about
Using HTML and CSS to make sure the website is nice looking and the user can interact with it.
N@TM: All wildcats available to learn about with a fully working search bar.
We will add more information on each of the wildcats and make the website better based of feedback
We will make it more user friendly and easier to access
Collegeboard: Touch up the website and do final changes to make the website the best of our ability.
We have to make sure this art piece is completely refined and everything is working. The code is running smoothly, there are databases, everything looks nice, and the domain is set up.

WOW factor: Crazy facts and information that few people know about the animals we discuss. Perhaps a way of getting facts: 100 weird facts book, Joe Roganhas some crazy videos about animals, 

Big Ticket Idea: Search Bar that searches from the database on the animals we have put information on.
